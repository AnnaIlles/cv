       <p class="about">
        I think it is hard to describe and tell in a few sentences who we really are, but maybe a good starting point is to talk about that what we do for a living. I am currently working as a communications assistant at one of the UN’s specialized agencies: Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). Although, I studied law and started my career as a lawyer candidate I ended up here because it was one of my dreams to work for an international organization. It has been a great experience and I will never regret my decision. I realized which is common in working as a clerk and as a communications assistant: you have to help, speak and work with people – and this is what I really love doing, so now I am looking for a new job where the focus is on people. In my spare time I usually learn coding (I started a web development course), I also really enjoy reading (<i class="fa fa-book" aria-hidden="true"></i>), love live music (<i class="fa fa-music" aria-hidden="true"></i>), my passion is travelling (<i class="fa fa-plane" aria-hidden="true"></i>) and I can never say no to a good coffee (<i class="fa fa-coffee" aria-hidden="true"></i>)!</p>
